| GET    | /games/:gameId/assets  | Returns assets needed to start game |                                                               | Returns game & target data, startTime, jsonwebtoken |
| POST   | /games/:gameId/guesses | Verify target coordinates           | { targetId, x: x% of image, y: y% of image }, token           | Returns guessSucess, targetsFound, targetsNotFound  |
| GET    | /winners               | Returns winners                     |                                                               | Returns list of winners' name, time, gameId         |
| POST   | /winners               | Create winner                       | token with confirmed win data, time to win in seconds         | Returns token and time if win verified, else 403    |
| PUT    | /winners               | Rename winner                       | { name }, token with winning player data (from POST /winners) | Returns updated winner if winner verified, else 403 |

### API Gameplay loop

1. call GET /games to get available games + image urls
2. call GET /games/:gameId/assets to retrieve game data and token to start gameplay
3. call POST /games/:gameId/guesses (with token) to play the game and make guesses (until all targets found)
    - Updated token will be returned to use on future /guesses requests (if guess is successful)
4. call POST /winners once all targets founds to record win time
5. call PUT /winners to let user name the winner

### Learning Outcomes

-   Backend

    -   Practice designing API and API workflow to play game
    -   First time using SuperTest to test route responses
    -   Practicing Jest and Test Driven Development
    -   Normalizing image coordinates

-   Frontend

    -   Global notifications using context API
        -   any component can trigger a notification by retrieving create notification functions using context API
    -   Relearning vitest (mocking hooks/components, user events, dynamic mocks, snapshot tests)
    -   Animating react components (fade ins, fade outs)

### Retrospective aka yapping

-   I really put my all into make this a project I can showcase on my portfolio. Hope you like it!
-   I learned I prefer working on backend then frontend (else I get confused!)
-   Designed API and API workflow myself (proud!)
-   Thought of storing player session info in jsonwebtoken myself (proud!!)
-   NOTIFICATIONS TOOK ME SO LONG BUT I DID IT I AM VERY PROUD OF MYSELF
-   I created a timer using intervals! first time using intervals
